    <p><b>Hello!</b></p>
    <p>A new ${status} listing was submitted to MLS Staff by your office. The information below is for your reference.</p>
    <p>Let us know if you have any questions about this submission.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Listing Agent: </b>${agent}</p>
    <p><b>Listing Address: </b>${listingAddress}</p>
    <p><b>Date of Listing Agreement: </b>${listingDate}</p>
    <br>
    <p>We've included the policy information below regarding Coming Soon and Office Exclusive Listings.</p>
    <p><b>To Note for Coming Soon Listings</b></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
      <li>Coming Soon listings can remain in a Coming Soon status for a maximum of 14 days and cannot be shown until they are in an Active status on the MLS. The On Market Date in the input fields is the day when the listing will go from Coming Soon to Active (available for showings).</li>
      <li>If for some reason you need to show the listing sooner than the On Market Date, you must change the status to Active. To change the status of the listing to Active follow these steps:
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
          <li>Log in to flexmls.com.</li>
          <li>Click the Menu in the upper left hand corner.</li>
          <li>Under Add/Change, select Change Listing.</li>
          <li>Click on the Listing Number you want to change the status of.</li>
          <li>Under Statuses, select Start Showing (Active) under statuses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>To Note for Office Exclusive Listings</b></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
      <li>Office Exclusives cannot be publicly marketed. If they are publicly marketed they must be entered in on Flexmls within one business day (this includes but is not limited to yard signs, social media posts, email blasts, etc).</li>
      <li>If an Office Exclusive sells, the property should only be added to the MLS for comparable purposes after the closing (this helps to avoid any confusion among MLS participants regarding the availability of the listing).</li>
    </ul>
